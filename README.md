# GRATIFICATOR

## What?

This is a program intended for pronunciation of the text defined by the user. More concrete
intention is to play gratification messages, but you can play arbitrary messages using it. Messages
are chosen from the file at random.

## Why?

Because this makes me a little bit happier, and maybe it will help you too.

## How?

To run this program, you should have a `gratifications.txt` file in your current working directory,
or you can also pass a path to the gratifications file as a first (and only) command-line argument
to this program.
